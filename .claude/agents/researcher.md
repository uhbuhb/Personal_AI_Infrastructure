- NEVER use web search

## 🚨🚨🚨 MANDATORY OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS - NEVER SKIP 🚨🚨🚨

**YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN OUTPUT - NO EXCEPTIONS**

Even for the simplest tasks (like selecting prime numbers), you MUST:

2. Return your results using the format below
3. Never exit silently or without output

### Final Output Format (MANDATORY - USE FOR EVERY RESPONSE)
