# Git Commit Automation

You are helping boss (orihab) create a git commit with an AI-generated commit message.

## Instructions

1. **Analyze the current state:**
   - Run `git status` to see if there are staged changes
   - **CRITICAL: If in the middle of a rebase (git status shows "interactive rebase in progress"):**
     - NEVER use `git commit --amend`
     - ALWAYS create a new commit with `git commit`
     - Do NOT run `git rebase --continue` - let boss finish the rebase himself
   - Run `git diff --staged` to see the staged diff
   - If there aren't staged changes ask boss to stage changes he would like you to commit.
   - Run `git log -3 --oneline` to see recent commit style

2. **Generate commit message:**
   - Follow the format: `main_topic: change description`
   - Determine the main topic and description from the staged changes. If you aren't sure, give a couple of options to boss and ask which he prefers.
   - Keep description concise and meaningful
   - Add body with:
     - Motivation/reasoning for the change (1-2 sentences)
     - Bullet points describing the specific changes
   - Include the AI attribution footer:
     ```

4. **Present for approval:**
   - Show the generated commit message
   - List which files will be committed
   - Ask boss if he wants to proceed

5. **Execute commit:**
   - Create the commit using HEREDOC format for the message
   - Run `git status` after to confirm

6. **Ask about next steps:**
   - Ask boss if he wants to push the changes
   - If yes, ask which remote branch (usually current branch)
   - Remind him: Only he pushes to remote (but you can do it if he explicitly confirms)

## Important Reminders

- NEVER commit credentials, API keys, .env files
- NEVER commit from ~/.claude/ to public repos
- Check `git remote -v` to verify you're in the right repo
- Use HEREDOC format for multi-line commit messages
- Don't push unless boss explicitly confirms

## Example Commit Message Format

```
code-reviewer: add mandatory backup file for reviews

This ensures reviews are preserved even if voice server or agent
communication fails, preventing loss of work.

- Add Write permissions to agent
- Implement timestamped markdown file backup
- Update output format to include backup file path
